# Risks

## External (Threats)
- The app should under no circumstances lose more than the last hour of data
- SQL Azure must be at Standard or greater to support continuous backup
- Exposing APIs for the application and its analysis data may also expose it further to malicious attacks.
- Default ASP.NET implementations require a few tweaks to meet our Security standards. (TODO: link to standard security modifications)
	
## Internal (Weaknesses)
- Although the team dynamic may be tight now, the team will be disbanded. Code and document for happiness and success of future developers!
